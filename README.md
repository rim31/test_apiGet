# CREATE a ReactJS web page using a API : one week end challenge to learn and test


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Table of Contents

  - [npm install](#npm-install)
  - [npm start](#npm-start)


## Marvel_lous

- get data from Api
- display heroes
- do not display detail of a hero / router
- only localhost:3000 and localhost:3000/cards


### Difficulties

- API --> postman
- Router --> href to component in an other page
- state / props  <Components data={this.state.data}> ==> this.state.props

### Solution

- route localhost:3000/cards/{id} , parse id et get API with the id
